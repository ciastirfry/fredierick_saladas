## 🧠 About Me

I am a results-driven DevOps Engineer with over **9 years of experience** in automating, optimizing, and securing cloud infrastructure across large enterprise environments (Standard Chartered, DBS, Citibank). Currently enhancing my capabilities through a Master’s in Software Engineering at Yoobee College, I blend hands-on engineering with strategic architecture, specializing in:

- Cloud (AWS, Azure)
- CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)
- Containerization (Kubernetes, Docker, Podman)
- Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch)
- Security, automation, cost optimization, and more
